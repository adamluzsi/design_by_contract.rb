### Interface

The most basic simple usecase for interface is to use it for simply validate a class

```ruby

i = DesignByContract::Interface.new test: [:req, :opt, %i[keyreq keyword] ]

class T
  def test(value, value_with_default="def", keyword:)
  end
end

i.implemented_by?(T) #=> true
i.implemented_by?(Class) #=> false

```
